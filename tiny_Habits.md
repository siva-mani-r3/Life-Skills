https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8

The most interesting idea was how starting with a tiny habit, like flossing just one tooth, can lead to building a long-lasting habit without feeling overwhelmed. It showed that making habits really small removes resistance and makes change easier.

M - Motivation  
A - Ability  
P - Prompt  

I will set small reminders to practice coding every day (prompt). Since the tasks will be easy and quick (ability), and I want to improve my skills (motivation), this formula will help me form consistent habits.

### Question 3 __Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)  

Celebrating success creates positive feelings that reinforce the habit. When I celebrate completing a task, I want to feel that joy again, making me more likely to repeat the habit and turn it into a routine.

The idea that small habits act like compound interest over time was very interesting. Tiny improvements stack up and eventually create big changes in life, showing the importance of daily consistent effort.

The book explains that changing our identity (how we see ourselves) is key to lasting change. When we adopt tiny habits, over time they reshape our identity and who we believe we are.

### Question 6 __Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?  

We can make habits easier by changing our environment. For example, keeping a book on my desk will make me more likely to read because the cue is obvious and easy to act on.

### Question 7 __Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?  

Making habits harder can involve adding friction. For example, if I want to use my phone less, I can turn it off or put it in another room, so itâ€™s less convenient to use.

### Question 8 __Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?  

I want to read more books.  
- I will keep a book next to my bed as a visible cue.  
- I will start with just one page a day (making it easy).  
- I will celebrate finishing each page to feel good and stay motivated.

### Question 9 __Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?  

I want to reduce scrolling on my phone.  
- I will turn off unnecessary notifications (making the cue invisible).  
- I will uninstall social media apps to make access harder.  
- I will replace the habit with reading or walking to satisfy the urge differently.
